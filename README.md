py-lightpack
============

This is a Python library for controlling [Lightpack](http://lightpack.tv/)

It is a fork of [the official Python library](https://github.com/Atarity/Lightpack/blob/master/Software/apiexamples/pyLightpack/lightpack.py), which at the time of writing is buggy, unpackaged, unmaintained and undocumented.
The goal of this project is to address those issues and make other improvements.
